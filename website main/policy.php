            <p>We conduct summer and winter internships every year. Under policy internship, interns gain practical experience of various Road Safety issues. Further brainstorming on the solutions that are required to be implemented. Work is done on analyzing problems, researching existing solutions, designing solutions, justifying the need and feasibility of the solutions and also trying to get them implemented through repective Government Authorities. The aim is to bring ground level changes in the field of road-safety by analysing real-life problems, surveying and designing feasible solutions and getting them implemented with the help of government authorities, thereby contributing towards IRSC’s vision of reducing road accidents by half by 2020

                                a)The left area near the wine and beer shop at Savitri Cinema Complex used to be a congested area which has now been made a No Parking Zone which has made it easier for the movement of the traffic.
                                <br/>b)The reflectors on the U-Turn at Savitri Complex have been replaced with new ones which has led to proper visibility and decreased number of road accidents at one of the most prominent places of South-Delhi.
                                <br/>c)The manual control of the traffic signals at Chirag Delhi junction has been under a better monitoring technique wherein the timings have been reduced upto 100 seconds from 150 second which has led to better controlling by freeing up the left lane.
                                <br/>d)Timings of the traffic signal were taken care of at the Chirag Delhi crossing.<br>
