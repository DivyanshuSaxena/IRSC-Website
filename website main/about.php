                <p>Indian Roads Safety Campaign, is the road safety initiative of Solve, a trust started by the students and alumni of IIT Delhi to solve the problems plaguing the society on the ground level. IRSC (Solve) is the largest youth led organisation working towards the mission of making Indian Roads Safer, focusing on reducing the number of deaths caused by road accidents across India by half till 2020. We are currently active in 50+ cities with over 1700+ volunteers and have impacted more than 1 crore people in across 10 states in India.</p>

                <p>The Indian Road Safety Campaign was started when few students of IIT Delhi lost their precious life in a road accident just after being placed in well reputed firms. We started as a project under National Service Scheme, IIT Delhi. Currently, have grown to be a youth led national level organization with the collaborative and supportive effort of MoRTH (Ministry of Road Transport and Highways), Delhi Traffic Police, College Chapters under IRSC, Intern Teams and various schools. The active involvement of governmental bodies and international bodies like United Nations indicate that we have been successfully recognised by the government for our work towards road safety and have so far received optimum support towards proper management for all our work. There are various methodologies inclusive of awareness sessions, policy and technical internships, workshops, competitions and marathons through which we have been able to sensitize and impact 25,00,000+ people directly, igniting in them a sense of need and responsibility to start working on the much ignored issue of road safety.

	               <p>AN OVERVIEW
                    <ul>
                      <li>1.3 million people died due to preventable car crashes in the past decade.</li>
                      <li>17 lives in India are lost due to road crashes every hour. </li>
                      <li>5.3 million people have been seriously injured in road crashes in the past decade....</li>
                    </ul>
                    .... And the numbers keep increasing. As long as road safety is not appreciated, and not a way of life, each and every one of us put their life at stake whenever we commute by any means. Driving on an Indian highway for 400km exposes you to 8-9 micromort risk of dying, which makes it as dangerous an activity as skydiving!
                  </p>

                  <p>  IRSC, along with WHO and MoRTH, aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. Hence, we, MoRTH and WHO share the vision to save millions of lives by making Indian Roads Safer. We want to see these numbers go down and be cut to half by 2020. We plan to achieve this by working constructively with the government and bring basic policy level and structural changes, and by doing technical innovations in the field of road safety, backed up by the various IITs, and numerous other colleges around India  working tirelessly with us to achieve the same</p>
